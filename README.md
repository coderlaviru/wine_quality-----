## 📊 Data Description

The dataset contains information about different **physicochemical properties of wine samples**. The attributes include:

- **Volatile Acidity**  
- **Citric Acid**  
- **Residual Sugar**  
- **Density**  
- **Alcohol Content**  
- **Quality** (Target variable ranging from 0-10)

## 🔍 How the Model Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - The dataset undergoes cleaning and normalization.
   - It splits into features (input data) and the target variable (wine quality).

2. **Model Training**  
   - A machine learning model is trained on the preprocessed dataset using a classification algorithm.
   - The model aims to learn patterns in wine attributes to predict their quality score accurately.

3. **Evaluation**  
   - The model is tested on unseen data.
   - Performance metrics include **accuracy, precision**, and **confusion matrix**.
